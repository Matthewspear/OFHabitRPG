## Currently NOT WORKING


Gain experience (on HabitRPG) for the tasks you have completed with OmniFocus.

This is a very simple applescripts that counts the number of completed tasks within the last day,
then sends a script to HabitRPG.

## Setup

To use replace the lines:

    x-api-user: aaaaa000-aa00-0000-0a00-a0000a00aa00' -H 'x-api-key: 0a0000a0-0a0a-000a-0000-00a000aaa000'

with your HabitRPG User ID and API Token which can be found [here](https://habitrpg.com/#/options/settings/api).

To use the script run at the end of a working day and a dialog box will show how many tasks you have completed. By clicking 'ok' The script will tell HabitRPG to press the + button on the productive habit that many time.

I am reasonably new to GitHub and am in the process of learning all the commands, I have plans to get this working on a per task basis, assign different levels of difficulty per task and an ignore option.
